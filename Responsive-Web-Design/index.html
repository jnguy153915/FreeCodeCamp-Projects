  <h2>Here are the events of Hercules' life from beginning to end:</h2>
  
  <div id="early">
  <h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3> 
    <p>Hercules was born from Zeus, the Olympian King of Gods, and Alcmene, the granddaughter of the previous hero, Perseus.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
  <h3><strong>Hera’s Revenge</strong></h3> 
    <p>Hera, the wife of Zeus, fell into a rage when she had heard that Zeus had an affair. Out of jealousy, she prevented Hercules from becoming the ruler of Mycenae by sending two snakes to kill him. Unfortunately, due to his unusual strength, her plan failed when Hercules was able to kill both snakes sent to kill him as a child. But Hera kept up her dirty scheme. When Hercules was a young adult, she casted a spell on him that drove him temporarily insane and caused him to murder his wife and their two children. Guilty and heartbroken, Hercules tracked down Apollo, the god of truth and healing (and another of Zeus’ sons), and begged to be punished for what he had done. </p>

    <h3><strong>The Heroic Labors of Hercules</strong></h3>
    <p>Apollo understood that Hercules’ crime had not been his fault, but he insisted that the Hercules should make amends. He ordered Hercules to perform 12 heroic labors for the Mycenaen king Eurystheus. Once Hercules completed every one of the labors, Apollo declared, he would be absolved of his guilt and achieve immortality.</p>

  <h3>Immortality</h3>
    <p>Later in his life, Hercules had a number of other adventures, such as rescuing the princess of Troy, battling for control of Mount Olympus. However, none of those adventures were as taxing, or as significant, as the labors he had done. When he died, Athena carried him to Olympus on her chariot. According to legend, he spent the rest of eternity with the gods.</p>
